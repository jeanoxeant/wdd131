            <p>Hello! My name is Jean Rubin Oxeant. I am from Haiti. I am a civil engineer. I have a beautiful family
                with two sons. I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints since 2005. I served a
                fulltime mission on 2007-2009. I love playing piano, reading and helping people. I had the
                opportunity to be professors’ assistant in PUCMM where I have helped some students to
                achieve their goal. I worked as a subcontractor engineer and I was able to hire many young men
                who did not have a job to take care of their family.
                I love teaching. In different occasion, I used my hability to teach people in different branches:
                like English, piano and so on…
                I am a hard worker. I like to finish anything that I start. I do not like to start when I know
                that I will not be able to finish it. Enduring to the end is my passion. I am very passionated about computer programming.
                Even though it is a hard work to do, but I love challenging stuff.
            </p>
